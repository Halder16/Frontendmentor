## Overview

This project is a blog preview card designed to enhance front-end development skills through practical implementation. It incorporates key concepts such as responsive design, CSS layout techniques, and attention to user experience. The component aims to create a clean, functional design with interactive elements that adapt to various screen sizes.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started by structuring the blog review card layout using Flexbox, arranging the provided images and text to match the reference design. I divided the card into sections (image, heading, description, and author info) and refined their positioning with padding and margins. Using the measurements, colors, and typography from the Figma file as a guide, I made small tweaks to closely match the design. Finally, I ensured the layout looked good on both mobile and desktop screens.

### Built with

- CSS for styling  
- Flexbox for layout  
- Visual Studio Code with Live Server extension for real-time updates
- Figma (for reference design and measurements)

### What I learned

In this project, I gained a better understanding of importing fonts locally available on my device.

### Continued development

I plan to improve my typography integration to create more cohesive and visually appealing designs. Additionally, I would like to experiment with CSS Grid as an alternative to Flexbox to explore its potential and versatility in future projects.
