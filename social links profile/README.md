## My process

I started by working with flexboxes to organize the content. Initially, I placed all the elements into their respective flex containers to build a foundational structure. Then, I focused on gradually refining the layout, ensuring the content aligned correctly. Once the structure was in place, I began applying colors, carefully matching them to the provided reference. Lastly, I revisited and adjusted minor details, fine-tuning the layout to enhance the overall appearance and ensure it met the design requirements.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Visual Studio Code with Live Server extension for real-time updates

### What I learned

While working on this card, I reinforced my understanding of flexbox for structuring layouts and gained more confidence in applying it effectively. I also practiced importing fonts locally, which improved my workflow. A new and specific learning moment for me was using the CSS `letter-spacing` property to adjust text spacing. These small but valuable experiences added to my overall skill set.

### Continued development

I plan to improve my typography integration to create more cohesive and visually appealing designs. Additionally, I would like to experiment with CSS Grid as an alternative to Flexbox to explore its potential and versatility in future projects.
